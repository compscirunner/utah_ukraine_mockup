                    <br><br>
                    Since the start of the full-scale Russian invasion, we have collected and delivered close to 1000 boxes of supplies to Ukraine! 
                    We work with Lifting Hands International and Caritas Mostyska to deliver humanitarian aid.
                    You can drop off donations at LHI warehouse, 920 E State St, American Fork, 9 a.m. to 1 p.m. Mon-Fri.
                    For more information, <a href="https://www.liftinghandsinternational.org/needs-list"
                        target="_blank">click here</a>. Please note that they can always use volunteers to package and label the boxes,
                    including writing Ukrainian labels on them. Please consider helping out with this task, this really helps the volunteers at the border!

                    The following items have been donated by the amazing community in Utah during our March-April
                    donation drive.
                    <br><br>
                    They have been collected, moved, sorted, packed, labeled and inventorized
                    by UUA volunteers with generous help from Lifting Hands International. Lion Energy has kindly
                    provided a warehouse space,
                    and helped palletize the boxes and repalletize them again when the cargo requirements changed.
                    Our friends from Big Ocean Women included their donations into the shipment as well, collecting some
                    really critical tactical defense gear.
                    <br><br>
                    The items were shipped to Europe, and from there to the Polish-Ukrainian border. During May-early
                    June, our partners at Caritas have helped
                    distribute these donations to Bucha, Brovary, Kyiv, Zaporizhzhia, Kharkiv, Chuhuiv, Azov, Dnipro and
                    Donetsk region, among other places.:

                    The migration of Ukrainian refugees has prompted swift international and regional responses,
                    but such momentum is unlikely to sustain itself. Some world entities are already calling the refugee
                    situation
                    a ‘humanitarian crisis.’
                    <br><br>
                    We ask that the U.S. government waive U.S. visa requirements and/or grant refugee status to the
                    Ukrainian nationals.
                    The U.S. government and its constituents can save and shape many Ukrainian lives, which are now
                    being abruptly
                    and senselessly destroyed due to the unprovoked invasion of their country. Every day matters, so

                    UUA is extremely thankful to Jonathan Lysenko, Mark Earnshaw, the Vision band and the Choral Arts
                    Society of Utah for putting together
                    a concert in support of Ukraine in Centerville. The organizers decorated the entire Founder's Park
                    in Ukrainian and American flags,
                    and the choir sang the beautiful prayer for Ukraine by Ukrainian composer Mykola Lysenko. The

                    donated their time and talent to the cause.

                    <b>What is the most effective way to help with the war efforts right now?</b>
                    Please call your representatives and write to them, asking to provide additional fighter jets and
                    air defense systems to Ukraine.
                    UUA is also accepting donations and sending supplies to Ukraine. Financial donations are most
                    helpful. They allow us
                    to purchase supplies in bulk, and cover the most immediate needs based on requests of our partners
                    in Ukraine.
                    They also allow us to buy supplies in Europe that may not be easily shipped from the US.
                    <br><br>
                    <b>What will my donation go to?</b>
                    100% of your donations go to buy life-saving tactical gear such as bulletproof vests;
                    to charitable organizations that we have found to be effective and transparent, to hospitals,
                    to civilian populations in the most heavily bombed cities,
                    and to internally displaced persons in Ukraine who had to flee the bombings.
                    <br><br>
                    <b>How do I know my donations will arrive in Ukraine successfully?</b>
                    UUA has been regularly shipping humanitarian supplies to Ukraine since 2015. We have delivered
                    several shipments successfully since
                    the start of the full-scale Russian invasion. We work with established organizations on the ground
                    in Europe and Ukraine to make sure your donations reach the areas with the most dire need. We
                    provide photo reports of each step of the process.
                    <br><br>
                    <b>I am a Ukrainian already in Utah but don't have a permanent residency or citizenship. What are my

                        This will cost you nothing, and every time you shop, Amazon will donate a percentage to the charity.<br>
                        It is a simple way to help and only takes a couple of minutes to set up. Again, this will not cost you a cent, all donations are done by Amazon, not by you.
