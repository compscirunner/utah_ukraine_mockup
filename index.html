                We have just finished a donation drive and collected 13 tons of supplies! The first 10 tons are on their way to Ukraine now 
                and the next shipment is planned. We are not actively collecting supplies at the moment, but if we made prior arrangements with your group, 
                we are still happy to receive the items to be included in the next shipment. For any supply donations beyond that, we are recommending 
                a wonderful resource we have been collaborating with, Lifting Hands International. You can find more information

                    The migration of Ukrainian refugees has prompted swift international and regional responses, 
                    but such momentum is unlikely to sustain itself. Some world entities are already calling the refugee situation 
                    a ‘humanitarian crisis.’ 
                    We ask that the U.S. government waive U.S. visa requirements and/or grant refugee status to the Ukrainian nationals.
                    The U.S. government and its constituents can save and shape many Ukrainian lives, which are now being abruptly 
                    and senselessly destroyed due to the unprovoked invasion of their country. Every day matters, so please act now!

                <b>What will my donation go to?</b>
                100% of your donations go to buy life-saving tactical gear such as bulletproof vests; 
                to charitable organizations that we have found to be effective and transparent, to hospitals,
                to civilian populations in the most heavily bombed cities,
                and to internally displaced persons in Ukraine who had to flee the bombings. 
                <br><br>
                <b>How do I know my donations will arrive in Ukraine successfully?</b>
                UUA has been regularly shipping humanitarian supplies to Ukraine since 2015. We have delivered several shipments successfully since 
                the start of the full-scale Russian invasion. We work with established organizations on the ground 
                in Europe and Ukraine to make sure your donations reach the areas with the most dire need. We provide photo reports of each step of the process.
                <br><br>
                <b>I am a Ukrainian already in Utah but don't have a permanent residency or citizenship. What are my options?</b>
                You may qualify for Temporary Protected Status (TPS) or Extension of Stay. Please reach out via email or our Facebook page, 
                and we will connect you with an attorney.
