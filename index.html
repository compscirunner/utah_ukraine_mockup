                    IMPORTANT! WE HAVE AN ONGOING DONATION DRIVE FOR UKRAINE. 
                <br><br>
                    The deadline for donations has been extended to April 1. We truly appreciate the overwhelming interest from individuals,<br> 
                    organizations and businesses in the community. While some of our drop-off locations are already full, we are regularly<br>
                    updating the list below with new locations. 
                <br><br>
                    Many of you ask about the difference between the LHM initiative and the UUA donation drive. The items gathered through LHM<br> 
                    will go to help Ukrainian refugees. The donations UUA gather will be distributed inside Ukraine, to volunteer defense force<br> 
                    and civilians in need. There is a dire need in both areas, and we appreciate your assitance with either one.
                 <br><br>
                    We are asking for donations in the following areas. Please note that the weather is getting warmer in Ukraine now and<br> 
                    previously needed items for very cold weather are no longer requested. Please keep that in mind if buying any clothing items.

                    <p style="font-family:calibri;font-size:16px">Dear Utahns, we need your help collecting 100,000 signatures for 
                    <a href="https://www.change.org/p/grant-refugee-status-to-the-ukrainian-nationals-in-the-u-s" target="_blank">this petition</a>.
                    The migration of Ukrainian refugees has prompted swift international and regional responses, 
                    but such momentum is unlikely to sustain itself. Some world entities are already calling the refugee situation 
                    a ‘humanitarian crisis.’ 
                    We ask that the U.S. government waive U.S. visa requirements and/or grant refugee status to the Ukrainian nationals.
                    The U.S. government and its constituents can save and shape many Ukrainian lives, which are now being abruptly 
                    and senselessly destroyed due to the unprovoked invasion of their country. Every day matters, so please act now! 
                </p>

                <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
                <p style="font-family:calibri;font-size:16px">
                <b>What is the most effective way to help with the war efforts right now?</b>
                Please call your representatives and write to them, asking to provide additional fighter jets and air defense systems to Ukraine. 
                In addition, ask them to allow Ukrainian refugees to come to the U.S. 
                UUA is also accepting donations and sending supplies to Ukraine. Financial donations are most helpful as they allow us 
                to purchase items that may not be easily available or most weather appropriate given the shipment date.
                <br><br>
                <b>What will my donation go to?</b>
                100% of your donations go to supplies for territorial defense forces protecting civilians in Ukraine, 
                to civilian populations in the most heavily bombed cities, and to internally displaced persons in Ukraine who escaped the bombings. 
                <br><br>
                <b>How do I know my donations will arrive in Ukraine successfully?</b>
                UUA has been regularly shipping humanitarian supplies to Ukraine since 2015. We have already delivered a shipment successfully 
                since the start of the war and are finalizing the second shipment. We work with established organizations on the ground 
                in Europe and Ukraine to make sure your donations reach the areas with the most dire need. We provide photo reports of each step of the process.
                <br><br>
                <b>I am a Ukrainian already in Utah but don't have a permanent residency or citizenship. What are my options?</b>
                You may qualify for Temporary Protected Status (TPS) or Extension of Stay. Please reach out via our Facebook page, 
                and we will connect you with an attorney.
                <br><br>
                <b>Can my Ukrainian loved ones come to Utah as refugees?</b>
                This is not yet possible. We are petitioning the local government to start receiving Ukrainians in Utah. 
                Please add your name to support 
                <a href="https://www.change.org/p/grant-refugee-status-to-the-ukrainian-nationals-in-the-u-s" target="_blank">this petition</a>.
                <br><br>
                <b>I would like to host Ukrainian refugees. Where do I start?</b>
                While Ukrainian refugees cannot yet arrive here, please fill out  
                <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfF-1-QqEQyjoLZC6bTvvpJqTtWr19h-oN91P8croPa61HMjA/viewform?fbclid=IwAR1-960wuh57D_v2r-yrdJGIMH7WtdkhoC5HPHY-62PYucUK5pq4UQGOgA8" target="_blank">this form</a> 
                and we will connect you with families who applied for TPS or Extended Stay. Please also add your name to

                asking the Utah government to start receiving Ukrainian refugees.
                <br><br>
                <b>Where can I buy a Ukrainian flag in Utah?</b>
                We recommend Colonial Flag, 9390 S 300 W, Sandy, UT 84070. They have generously supported UUA with a donation, put up Ukrainian flags by their store, 
                and lit up their building in blue and yellow at night. Please support them back!

                        organization that addresses various humanitarian needs in Ukraine
                        with the help of Utah community. The group consists of volunteers who support Ukraine. We always
                        welcome and appreciate help from everyone with Ukrainian roots,
                        connections, or anyone with interest in Ukraine.

                        Founded in 2015, the association has been organizing aid shipments to children's homes, women's
                        shelters, and families of fallen soldiers.
                        UUA has put up 5K races, silent auctions, and community events celebrating Ukrainian culture and
                        heritage.
                        <br><br>
                        With the start of Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022, the association has been focusing on 
                        amplifying Ukrainian voices, organizing community rallies and fundraisers, 
                        and sending aid to address critical humanitarian needs in Ukraine.
