                    In the time of the ongoing Russian invasion of Ukraine, Leleka Foundation is focusing on the urgent
                    provision of critical medical supplies to Ukraine’s defenders and civilians.
                    For this purpose, they have built a logistics chain to deliver all supplies to Poland from where
                    their partners can deliver them further to recipients in Ukraine.
                    <br><br>
                    Once the supplies are delivered to Poland, they are taken to the border of Ukraine.
                    From here, the shipments go to the organization's main base of supplies in Lviv, Ukraine.
                    Here the organization is working with local volunteers providing a business office and cars.
                    From Lviv the supplies are delivered to the front lines.
                    <br><br>
